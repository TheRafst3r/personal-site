<h2>Playing Video Games</h2>
<p>
  I have been playing video games since I was 7 years old. To me, it is not only
  fun but is akin to reading a book or watching a movie that is highly
  interactible. Until now, I am still passionate about the medium and I love
  talking about it.

<h2>Watching Movies and TV Shows</h2>
<p>
  For as long as I can remember, our family loves to watch movies in the theatre
  and that is thanks to my mother. Nothing beats the theatre experience with a
  bucket of delicious popcorn on your lap. My parents also owned a video rental
  store when I was younger so we had access to so many classic movies. I
  remember our made us watch the entire original Star Wars trilogy, Indiana
  Jones trilogy, and even the Back to the Future trilogy. Because of this,
  movies are so ingrained in me that I don't think I will ever not love going to
  the theatre.
